NppLogCat
=========

A Notepad++ Custom "Language" for LogCat logs.

A custom language for use with Notepad++, which can be downloaded from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.6.html, to add color to your LogCat error logs that were saved to a text file. Since, as far as I know, you can not import the text files back into Eclipse, the only option is to look at a bunch of plain, boring black text that should be colorized to assist in finding the information tags, debug tags, warning tags, and error tags.

But now you can import the LogCat.xml into your Notepad++ Languages and get (partial*) colored lines for your LogCat files. Information is labeled green, debug is blue, warning is orange, and error is red. Just load Notepad++ and click Language -> Define your language… -> Import…, from there find the LogCat.xml file, select it and restart Notepad++. Now you can select LogCat as a language and have the part of each line highlighted with the appropriate colors!

*Currently only part of the line is colored and I will work on getting the full lines colored appropriatly similar to Eclipse LogCat.

INSTALL:

1. Open Notepad++
 
2. Click "Language"
 
3. Click "Define your language…"
 
4. Click "Import…"
 
5. Locate the LogCat.xml file and click Ok

6. Restart Notepad++ and the LogCat language will appear in the list of languages below the "Define your language…" option
